Things to ask Jimmy :
1. jira allocation for surbhi - should be done 
2.jira issues :
1.	Not able to move Epics across lanes in the OKP Kanban board – Here’s the link of the board. Can you check once?
https://tracker.wal-mart.com/secure/RapidBoard.jspa?rapidView=5030&projectKey=SOURCERX

2.	There are two OKP cards created in the SPINE board by Santosh. These cards are present in the OKP roadmap because they are tagged to the Sub-initiative OKP.
Can you remove those cards? Check the link below:
https://roadmap.walmart.com/#suballocations-1663014

3.	OKP Rewiring: Nick’s query vs OKP queries – This card is present in our board and is ‘In Progress’ but, is not linked to any of the epics. 
Should this card be moved back to ‘To Do’ lane as nothing should be worked on apart from Backlogs and User Telemetry?

4.	OKP JIRA board Admin access: When I open the link provided by Jimmy, I get the below message. (See screenshot below)
Should I raise an enable ticket to get access to GEC JIRA?

5. roadmap access and visibility of issues 

6. creation of sprint in jira 

7 . change mapping for chandan buddgiraja from : clarus analytical to SKPGTS (SKP best quality ) project
